## What is this 
This is a ***simple CLI calculator*** that can make *addition*, *subtraction*, *multiplication*, *division* and *power* from a math formula **(I mean that it's not like the one that asks you for the first operator then the second then the operator, this one can calculate from a hole formula full of operators and operands)**

## Why I made it ?
I created this calculator to practice dart programming since i needed to be familiar with **dart lang**.
